👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Oakes, a React Developer from Stoke-on-Trent, England.
I specialise in React.js and have experience working with technologies such as Swift, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. My main focus is building responsive, user-friendly web applications for small to medium-sized businesses.

I run my own freelance web development business, where I help businesses streamline their operations through custom web solutions.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Golang for backend development and diving into TypeScript to improve frontend type safety and code quality.

In my spare time, I’m a huge fan of the NFL 🏈 and Formula 1 🏎️.
